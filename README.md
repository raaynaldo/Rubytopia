Rubytopia
This is a small game where the user gets to use the portal of Rubytopia and travel to any mythological place he/she wishes to go! The user can
choose from a selection of Races to start their journey. 

This initially appeared on gist, but as I can no longer open that page as there are too many comments, I have moved it here.
